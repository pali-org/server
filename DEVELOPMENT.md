# Development Notes

## Current Status

The Pali server has been implemented with:
- Complete data models and database operations
- API key authentication system
- All endpoint handlers
- Comprehensive documentation

## Known Issues

### Handler Integration
The current implementation has compilation issues with Axum/Worker handler integration. The handlers are correctly implemented but need adjustment for the Worker runtime environment.

**Problem**: Axum handlers with `State<Env>` extractors aren't compatible with the Worker runtime's routing system.

**Solution Options**:
1. Use worker's native routing instead of Axum for better compatibility
2. Adjust handler signatures to match Worker's expected patterns
3. Use a different state management approach

### Next Steps

1. Fix handler compatibility with Worker runtime
2. Test API endpoints with actual Cloudflare deployment
3. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
4. Implement proper key rotation mechanism
5. Add database migrations system

## Architecture

The codebase is structured for maintainability:
- `models.rs` - Core data structures
- `db.rs` - Database operations
- `auth.rs` - Authentication middleware
- `handlers.rs` - HTTP endpoint handlers
- `lib.rs` - Main application setup

All modules include TODO comments for future improvements.
